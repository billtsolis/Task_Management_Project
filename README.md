# Task_Management_Project-

The code is running a web application for managing a task list. It consists of  Front-End(Javascript, css, html), Back-End (Node.js and Express). The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and displays the tasks in a list. The server-side handles the storage and retrieval of tasks in a MongoDB database.

To run the application, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed. You'll also need to install the required dependencies by running npm instal in the project directory. Then, you can start the server by running node server.js in the terminal. The MongoDB database running locally on the default port (27017). If you have a different MongoDB setup, you may need to modify the connection string in the server.js.
